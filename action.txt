Write me a shell wrapper script, with the same name as the the python script (md2pdf.py) put (with a .sh, md2pdf.sh) extension that would activate the virtual environment in this directory. It needs to be able to do this regardless of what is the current working directory of the shell is. Once the virtual environment is activated, the shell script needs to pass in its arguments to the python script while executing it.
